# Music Project for General Assembly

I submitted this project as my final assignment for the data science course at General Assemby.  The goal was to examine the attributes of songs labeled "house" in Echo Nest's API and cluster these songs into subgenres based on numeric attributes.  Part 1 contains code to download, clean, and examine the data. Part 2 contains the clustering algorithms.
